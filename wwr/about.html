        <section class="history">
                <p>Long time ago in a far away country a man by the name of George Washington sold their house and bought a
                McDonlds's franchise. However, everyone was buying BK's instead, so he sold it for $500 and bought a
                raft. He and his friend Joe Biden
                collobrarted together and eventually created a thriving rafting business. Eventually Biden wanted it all
                for himsef, and so he booted George Washington out, and George & his family went to some obscure place
                called USA.</p>
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Joe realized that being corrupt can make him a rich man beyond his dreams. And within a few
                years thru forceful, lying, & deceptive means, became a very wealthy man. And in time his company became
                the first trillion dollar company; suppassing Elon Musk as the richest man in the world. He eventually
                changed his name to Crooked Joe
                Biden, and won father of the year three time and became the most successful businessman of the century.</p>
