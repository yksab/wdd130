        <p>My name is Basky, and I'm from New Zealand. I'm studying the BYU software course and I really love it. I have
            tried in the past to learn programming but found it quite difficult to understand where and how to start.
            I'm enjoying the course and find it very interesting how these technologies that we use so often work in the
            background. One interesting thing is that I've found programming quite easy to comprehend. And this is only
            due to the simularities I find with mathematics. I enjoy maths and found that programming and maths have
            very much the same connection - as they are both logical in nature. Anyway that's about me.</p>

        <p>New Zealand is a beautiful place. It is sometimes called the land of the long white cloud. Many beautiful
            lakes, rivers, beaches, mountains dot the country; a very picturesque place.</p>
